## 🔴 Critical - Must Do Before Launch

### Security
- [ ] **Rotate Supabase Keys**
  ```bash
  # Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wdrlhevvavvaleasekge/settings/api
  # Click "Reset" next to anon/public key
  # Update .env with new key
  ```

- [ ] **Clean Git History**
  ```bash
  git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
    "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" \
    --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
  git push origin --force --all
  ```

- [ ] **Test RLS Policies** - Already configured ✅
  - cart_items, saved_products, orders, profiles, addresses all have RLS
  - Test with different users

### Error Tracking
- [ ] **Install Sentry**
  ```bash
  npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i reactNative
  # Add SENTRY_DSN to .env
  ```

### Testing
- [ ] **Install Test Dependencies**
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react-native \
    @testing-library/jest-native react-test-renderer
  ```
